# Dinodex

We're going to be creating an application that displays information about Dinosaurs
step by step. This will be an open-ended project so feel free to go in any direction
you wish.

This project is meant to use Java 11.

The program can be run with the following commands
```console
$ javac Dinosaur.java
$ java Dinodex.java
```

The expected output is below:

```
Creating a Stegosaurus
Dinosaur Steps is 0
Walk your dinosaur
Dinosaur walked!
Dinosaur is an Herbivore!
Stegosaurus
-------
steps: 1
```
